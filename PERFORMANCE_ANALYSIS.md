# Performance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
This report identifies several performance optimization opportunities in the MedusaJS 2.0 boilerplate codebase. The analysis covers both backend and frontend components, with issues ranging from inefficient array operations to missing memoization opportunities.

## Backend Performance Issues

### 1. Inefficient Array Operations in Seed Script (HIGH IMPACT)
**File:** `backend/src/scripts/seed.ts`  
**Lines:** 334, 520, 620, 720  
**Issue:** Multiple O(n) `.find()` operations on `categoryResult` array  
**Impact:** 4x unnecessary iterations through category array during seeding  
**Current Code:**
```typescript
category_ids: [
  categoryResult.find((cat) => cat.name === "Shirts")!.id,
],
```
**Problem:** Each `.find()` operation iterates through the entire `categoryResult` array, resulting in O(4n) time complexity for category lookups.

### 2. API Key Lookup Pattern (MEDIUM IMPACT)
**File:** `backend/src/api/key-exchange/route.ts`  
**Lines:** 8-9  
**Issue:** `listApiKeys()` followed by `.find()` operation  
**Impact:** Fetches all API keys to find one specific key  
**Current Code:**
```typescript
const apiKeys = await apiKeyModuleService.listApiKeys();
const defaultApiKey = apiKeys.find((apiKey) => apiKey.title === 'Webshop');
```
**Problem:** Loads all API keys into memory when only one is needed.

### 3. Contact Service Query Pattern (LOW IMPACT)
**File:** `backend/src/modules/contact/service.ts`  
**Lines:** 35  
**Issue:** No pagination in `list()` method  
**Impact:** Potential memory issues with large datasets  
**Current Code:**
```typescript
async list(): Promise<ContactSubmission[]> {
  return await this.manager.find(ContactSubmission, {}, { orderBy: { created_at: "DESC" } })
}
```
**Problem:** Fetches all contact submissions without pagination limits.

## Frontend Performance Issues

### 4. Repeated Sorting Operations (MEDIUM IMPACT)
**Files:** Multiple cart/order components  
**Issue:** Same sorting logic duplicated across components  
**Impact:** Unnecessary computation and code duplication  
**Affected Files:**
- `storefront/src/modules/cart/templates/items.tsx` (lines 35-37)
- `storefront/src/modules/cart/templates/preview.tsx` (lines 28-30)
- `storefront/src/modules/order/components/items/index.tsx` (lines 21-23)
- `storefront/src/modules/layout/components/cart-dropdown/index.tsx` (lines 108-111)

**Current Pattern:**
```typescript
.sort((a, b) => {
  return (a.created_at ?? "") > (b.created_at ?? "") ? -1 : 1
})
```
**Problem:** Same sorting logic repeated in multiple components.

### 5. Missing Memoization Opportunities (LOW IMPACT)
**Files:** Various React components  
**Issue:** Missing `useMemo`/`useCallback` optimizations  
**Impact:** Unnecessary re-computations and re-renders  
**Examples:**
- Country options computation in `storefront/src/modules/layout/components/country-select/index.tsx`
- Payment method sorting in `storefront/src/modules/checkout/components/payment/index.tsx`
- Address filtering in `storefront/src/modules/checkout/components/shipping-address/index.tsx`

### 6. Middleware Region Caching (LOW IMPACT)
**File:** `storefront/src/middleware.ts`  
**Issue:** 1-hour cache with potential for optimization  
**Impact:** Repeated API calls for region data  
**Current Code:**
```typescript
if (
  !regionMap.keys().next().value ||
  regionMapUpdated < Date.now() - 3600 * 1000
) {
  // Fetch regions from Medusa
}
```
**Problem:** Cache invalidation could be more intelligent based on actual data changes.

## Recommended Implementation Priority

1. **Fix seed script array operations (HIGH IMPACT - IMPLEMENTED)**
   - Replace O(n) `.find()` operations with O(1) Map lookups
   - Reduces time complexity from O(4n) to O(n + 4)

2. **Optimize API key lookup pattern (MEDIUM IMPACT)**
   - Add filtering to `listApiKeys()` call or use direct lookup method
   - Reduce memory usage and improve response time

3. **Add pagination to contact service (LOW IMPACT)**
   - Implement limit/offset parameters in `list()` method
   - Prevent memory issues with large datasets

4. **Extract common sorting utilities (MEDIUM IMPACT)**
   - Create shared utility functions for common sorting patterns
   - Reduce code duplication and improve maintainability

5. **Add strategic memoization (LOW IMPACT)**
   - Add `useMemo`/`useCallback` to expensive computations
   - Reduce unnecessary re-renders in React components

6. **Improve middleware caching (LOW IMPACT)**
   - Implement smarter cache invalidation strategies
   - Consider using Redis or other caching solutions for production

## Performance Metrics

### Seed Script Optimization Impact
- **Before:** O(4n) time complexity for category lookups
- **After:** O(n + 4) time complexity with Map-based lookups
- **Improvement:** ~75% reduction in lookup operations for large category datasets

### Estimated Impact by Category
- **High Impact:** Seed script optimization - Significant improvement during database seeding
- **Medium Impact:** API patterns and sorting utilities - Moderate improvement in runtime performance
- **Low Impact:** Memoization and caching - Minor improvements in user experience

## Conclusion

The identified performance issues range from algorithmic inefficiencies to missing optimization opportunities. The implemented seed script optimization addresses the highest impact issue, while the remaining items provide a roadmap for future performance improvements. The fixes are prioritized by impact and implementation complexity, making it easy for the development team to address them incrementally.
